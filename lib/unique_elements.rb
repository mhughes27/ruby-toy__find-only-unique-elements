# This method takes an array of elements (these might be strings, integers, floats, or a
# combination of the above), and returns an array of the elements that appear once and only
# once.
def find_unique_elements(arr)
  
#Algorithmic Process
#Create an array that includes elements without the repeats
#Create a hash that pairs each element of the new array with how many times it appears in the original array
#Any key-value pair that has 1 for a value is unique and gets placed in the desired array
